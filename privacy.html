      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>ChessMate ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use the ChessMate mobile application (the "App"). By using the App you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>1. Information You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> email address, username, password (hashed) used for login and signup.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile data:</strong> display name, avatar/profile photo (if you choose to upload or take a photo), and other optional profile fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Friends and social data:</strong> friend requests you send or receive, friend lists, and social interactions inside the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Messages & chat:</strong> text messages you send via in-game or general chat. (See Data Use & Retention below.)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> information about how you interact with the App, game mode selections, match metadata (who played, duration, move history metadata but not necessarily full move storage unless required by functionality), crash logs, and performance data.</li>
        <li><strong>Device & connection data:</strong> device model, OS version, unique device identifiers, IP address, and network information used to enable online play.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Media & Permissions</h3>
      <p>Based on permissions you grant, the App may access the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> used only when you choose to take a profile photo or take a picture to share within the App. We do not access the camera unless you explicitly request it in the App.</li>

        <li><strong>Photos / Media / Storage:</strong> used to let you choose an existing image from your device for avatars or to save game screenshots (WRITE/READ access as required by Android versions).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>To provide and operate the App:</strong> enable gameplay (offline/AI/online), matchmaking with friends, spectator mode, chat, friend management, and profile features.</li>
        <li><strong>To communicate with you:</strong> account-related messages, support responses, and optional notifications about updates or game invitations.</li>
        <li><strong>For safety, moderation & anti-abuse:</strong> to detect and prevent fraud, enforce terms, and maintain a safe experience for users.</li>
        <li><strong>To improve the App:</strong> analyze usage patterns, debug crashes, and optimize performance.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Real-Time Chat, Multiplayer & Spectator Features</h2>
      <p>ChessMate supports real-time online play, in-game and general chat, and spectator mode to watch friends' matches live. Messages and match metadata necessary to run these features are transmitted between participating users and our servers (or third-party realtime services). You should avoid sharing highly sensitive personal information in public chat or profiles.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
      <p>We may share data with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> hosting, databases, analytics, push notifications, real-time communication providers and crash-reporting services. These providers process data solely on our behalf.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> when required by law, to respond to lawful requests, enforce our terms, or protect rights and safety.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain account and profile data for as long as necessary to provide the App and for legitimate business purposes (e.g., account recovery, fraud prevention). Chat messages, match history, and other user-generated content are retained based on feature needs and may be deleted upon user request in accordance with our account deletion process.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information using industry-standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. However, no transmission over the internet or storage system is 100% secure—please exercise caution and avoid sharing highly sensitive information in the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. If you are under 13, do not create an account or provide personal information. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the applicable age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Rights & Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account access & deletion:</strong> you can request access to or deletion of your account and personal data by contacting us (see Contact below). Some information may be retained for legal or legitimate business reasons.</li>
        <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> you can revoke camera, microphone, or photos permissions in your device settings. Revoking certain permissions may disable related features (e.g., taking an avatar photo or voice chat).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice via the App or by other means before those changes take effect. The "Last updated" date at the top will reflect when the policy was last revised.</p>
